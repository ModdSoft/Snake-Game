# Snake Game

Welcome to Snake Game! This classic arcade-style game brings back the nostalgia of the vintage snake game, where you control a growing snake as it maneuvers around the screen eating apples and avoiding collisions with itself.


## How To Play

**Controls:** 
- Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the direction of the snake's movement.

**Objective:** 
- Guide the snake to eat as many apples as possible without colliding with itself or the walls.
- Each time the snake eats an apple, it grows longer.

**Game Over:** 
- The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the walls.
- Your score will be displayed at the end of the game.

## Features

**Scoring:** 
- Each apple eaten increases your score.
- Try to beat your high score with each new game!

**Speed Increase:** 
- As the snake grows longer or as you progress through the game, the speed of the snake will increase, making the game more challenging.

**Responsive Controls:** 
- The controls are smooth and responsive, allowing for precise movement of the snake.

**Colorful Graphics:** 
- Enjoy vibrant graphics and animations that bring the game to life.

**Sound Effects:** 
- Immerse yourself in the game with engaging sound effects.
